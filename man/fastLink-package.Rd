\title{Fast Probabilistic Record Linkage with Missing Data}
\description{
\code{fastLink} implements methods developed by Enamorado, Fifield, and Imai (2018)
''Using a Probabilistic Model to Assist Merging of Large-scale Administrative Records'',
to probabilistically merge large datasets using the Fellegi-Sunter model
while allowing for missing data and the inclusion of auxiliary information.
The current version of this package conducts a merge of two datasets under
the Fellegi-Sunter model, using the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm. In addition,
tools for conducting and summarizing data merges are included.
